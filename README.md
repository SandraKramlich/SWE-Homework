# SWE-Homework
This repository is for the homework we got in software engineering class. It is about learning to refactor my code to get clean code. We get help from the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler, Kent Beck (Contributor), John Brant (Contributor), William Opdyke, don Roberts.
